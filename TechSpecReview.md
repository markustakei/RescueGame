# Tech Spec Review

## Feasibility

Overall, the game is generally feasible.  However, it was made clear between both of us that the store, level, ambulance driving, helicopter, and in-app purchase store were unfeasible.
Those components were simply to complicated to program due to their physics (for some of them) or the neccessity of complicated external libraries.
Moreover, the maps will have to be downsized to make this a feasible project in 12 - 16 days.  Otherwise, the majority of the time would be spent on artwork rather than actual programming.
However, this game is still difficult to implement.

## Priorities
Our first goal is to successfully design the EMT missions, which we have agreed upon is the easiest. Then, we can branch out to the other playable characters.
For each type of player, the design will start like this:
* implement the level class for that player
* implement the map and player design
* program the player functionalities

## Schedule (the bullet points list 12 days + 3 optional days afterwards)
* Program the constructors and function outline (name, arguments, return value)
* Start on EMT.  Design a working map with the character models.  Functions for the characters do not need to be programmed in.
* Work on the functions for EMT and related characters (movement)
* Work on the functions for EMT and related characters (conversation, special actions, health, stamina)
* Work on the functions for this player's specific weapon
* Program in the static and dynamic objects on the map
* Start on Police.  Design a working map with the character models.  Functions for the characters do not need to be programmed in.
* Work on the functions for Police and related characters (movement)
* Work on the functions for Police and related characters (conversation, special actions, health, stamina)
* Work on the functions for this player's specific weapon
* Start on Firefighter.  Design a working map with the character models.  Functions for the characters do not need to be programmed in.
* Work on the functions for Firefighter and related characters (movement)
## Optional
* Work on the functions for Firefighter and related characters (conversation, special actions, health, stamina)
* Work on the functions for this player's specific weapon
* Work on HUD overlay
